Hi, I’m @Algon-33
I’m interested in understanding understanding, the foundations of reality and origami. I'd like to know how our minds work, how the minds we make work, and how all minds should work. So think computationally bounded Bayesianism, funcitonal neuroscience/figuring out deep learning and logic/decision theory/comptability. That ties into what we can/can't know, which is why I really want to dig into complexity theory. Most all physics is beutiful, but I've had a thing for quantum foundations, chaotic systems and thermodynamics for a while

I'm currently working on solving a couple of problems, part of which involved creating an ad-detector with the aid of LLMs. Not too hard, but too expensive to run at large scale. For now. I'm sure better methods existed, but I have a flaw where I forget to search widely before tackling a problem. I'm gradually improving there. The current problem I need to solve is automatically generating interesting links for a piece of text. Message me if you're interested in that. And sadly, I'm still stuck on Brouwer's fixed point theorem! I'll get it some day.
