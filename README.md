Hi, I’m @Algon-33
I’m interested in understanding understanding, the foundations of reality and origami. Put a less obnoxious way, I'd like to know how our minds work, how the minds we make work, and how all minds should work. So think computationally bounded Bayesianism, funcitonal neuroscience/figuring out deep learning and logic/decision theory/comptability. That ties into what we can/can't know, which is why I really want to dig into complexity theory. Most all physics is beutiful, but I've had a thing for quantum foundations, chaotic systems and thermodynamics for a while.

I’m currently learning about how to implement a transformer, algorithms to use large language models as writing aids and what to expect out of GPT-4. 

I’m looking to collaborate on any ML experiments people find interesting, especially related to interpetability, SGD priors, training path dependancy and grokking.
